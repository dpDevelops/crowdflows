# crowdflows
This an attempt to implement the techniques described in a scholarly paper regarding real-time simulation on crowds through an environment

link to the paper:
https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/crowd-flows/continuum-crowds.pdf

the paper seeks to simplify the algorithms governing movement of the individual entities while maintaining the adaptability of a crowd to move through the environment and other opposing crowds.  I am writing this in GML (GameMaker Language) but i would recommend creating an implementation using a lower level language, one that supports multithreading, since a task such as this requires a significant amount processing power to run in real-time.
